# odin-recipes
today I learned about git and html, starting from git add., git commit -m, git push origin
and from html I learned, meta chartset, lang, doctype!, links, images, unordered list, ordered list, bold, italic, about headings too
and now I'm finishing my first project, namely Odin recipes, maybe that's all for now, thank you Odin project.
